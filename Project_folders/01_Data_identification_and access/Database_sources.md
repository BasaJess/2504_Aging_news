 Where are the renowned scientists publushed
 It would be convenient to store the date of the last retrieval of data for each database
 Save the code in a python file not in a jupyter notebook that may make it easier to run automatically

 as od April 25 I have +70 docs of the second database Springer Nature, in XML format. It would be convenient to create vectors ans store them and increase the vector DB
