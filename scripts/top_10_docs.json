The project was co-founded by Anton Kulaga and others, and involved a team of researchers and developers who contributed to various aspects of the project, including bioinformatic pipeline development, architecture development, team management, and article writing. The report describes the architecture of the Just-DNA-Seq platform, which uses Open Cravat module naming rules and design patterns to create a report pipeline. The platform uses post-aggregators to process data and save results in a SQLite database, and then uses a templating engine to generate reports. The document also includes acknowledgments and information about the availability of the source code."},{"Author":"Unknown","Date":"2025-04-26","Institution":"Unclear","Peer_Reviewed":"Unclear","Relevance_for_longevity":0.9,"Summary":"The document discusses the longevity record of Jeanne Louise Calment, who lived 122.45 years, making her the longest-lived person with a reliably documented age. The author argues that her record does not provide evidence that human longevity is approaching a biological limit, and that progress in increasing lifespans has been due to reductions in death rates and the postponement of high mortality rates to higher ages. The author also notes that the inclusion criteria for lists of supercentenarians, such as the Gerontology Research Group and Epstein lists, are not as strict as those of the International Database on Longevity (IDL) list."},{"Author":"Unknown","Date":"2025-04-13","Institution":"Based on the provided context, here are the names of the institutions that published the articles:\n\n1.

The study also included a dataset of elderly people, aged over 18 years old, for comparison.

The author suggests that an information-rich environment can affect biological parameters and lead to a reduced rate of senescence.

It argues that an organism's structural complexity determines its potential for longevity, as well as its capacity for basic functionality and functional compensation. The document also notes that the time required for an organism's development is directly related to its structural complexity, and that a higher structural complexity does not necessarily translate to a higher level of functionality.
