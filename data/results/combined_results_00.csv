The author identifies specific regions of the RB protein that may be involved in these processes, including docking sites for other molecules, calcium binding sites, and sequences that resemble other proteins involved in insulin signaling and oxygen binding. The author suggests that RB may play a role in blocking insulin receptor activation, countering neurodegeneration, and promoting cell survival, among other functions."

The authors use a computational model to simulate the progression of AF in four ""patients"" with different levels of uncoupling, which is the reduction of electrical connections between cardiac cells. The results show that as uncoupling increases, the number of initiating critical regions (regions that can trigger AF) increases, and the average AF burden (the duration and frequency of AF episodes) also increases. The authors suggest that this variability in AF patterns may be due to differences in myocardial architecture between individuals."
